        The data to be modelled as a fuzzy simplicial set.

    n_neighbors: int
        The number of neighbors to use to approximate geodesic distance.
        Larger numbers induce more global estimates of the manifold that can
        miss finer detail, while smaller values will focus on fine manifold
        structure to the detriment of the larger picture.

    random_state: numpy RandomState or equivalent
        A state capable being used as a numpy random state.

    metric: string or function (optional, default 'euclidean')
        The metric to use to compute distances in high dimensional space.
        If a string is passed it must match a valid predefined metric. If
        a general metric is required a function that takes two 1d arrays and
        returns a float can be provided. For performance purposes it is
        required that this be a numba jit'd function. Valid string metrics
        include:
            * euclidean (or l2)
            * manhattan (or l1)
            * cityblock
            * braycurtis
            * canberra
            * chebyshev
            * correlation
            * cosine

            * sqeuclidean
            * yule
            * wminkowski

        Metrics that take arguments (such as minkowski, mahalanobis etc.)
        can have arguments passed via the metric_kwds dictionary. At this
        time care must be taken and dictionary elements must be ordered
        appropriately; this will hopefully be fixed in the future.

    metric_kwds: dict (optional, default {})
        Arguments to pass on to the metric, such as the ``p`` value for
        Minkowski distance.

    knn_indices: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors) (optional)
        If the k-nearest neighbors of each point has already been calculated
        you can pass them in here to save computation time. This should be
        an array with the indices of the k-nearest neighbors as a row for
        each data point.

    knn_dists: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors) (optional)
        If the k-nearest neighbors of each point has already been calculated
        you can pass them in here to save computation time. This should be
        an array with the distances of the k-nearest neighbors as a row for
        each data point.

    angular: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to use angular/cosine distance for the random projection
        forest for seeding NN-descent to determine approximate nearest
        neighbors.

    set_op_mix_ratio: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Interpolate between (fuzzy) union and intersection as the set operation
        used to combine local fuzzy simplicial sets to obtain a global fuzzy
        simplicial sets. Both fuzzy set operations use the product t-norm.
        The value of this parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0; a value of
        1.0 will use a pure fuzzy union, while 0.0 will use a pure fuzzy
        intersection.

    local_connectivity: int (optional, default 1)
        The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number of nearest
        neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local level.
        The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
        locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
        dimension of the manifold.

    verbose: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to report information on the current progress of the algorithm.
